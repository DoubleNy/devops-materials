  ## The Heroku Platform

Heroku is a platform as a service based on a managed container system, with [integrated data services](https://www.heroku.com/managed-data-services) and a powerful ecosystem, for deploying and running modern apps. The Heroku developer experience is an app-centric approach for software delivery, integrated with today’s most popular developer tools and workflows.

## Heroku Runtime

Heroku runs your apps inside [dynos](https://www.heroku.com/dynos) — smart containers on a reliable, [fully managed runtime environment](https://www.heroku.com/platform/runtime). Developers deploy their code written in [Node](https://www.heroku.com/nodejs), [Ruby](https://www.heroku.com/ruby), [Java](https://www.heroku.com/java), [PHP](https://www.heroku.com/php), [Python](https://www.heroku.com/python), (Go)https://www.heroku.com/go, [Scala](https://www.heroku.com/scala), or [Clojure](https://www.heroku.com/clojure) to a build system which produces an app that's ready for execution. The system and language stacks are monitored, patched, and upgraded, so it's always ready and up-to-date. The runtime keeps apps running without any manual intervention.

## Heroku Developer Experience (DX)

The [Heroku Developer Experience](https://www.heroku.com/dx) is an app-centric approach to software delivery so developers can focus on creating and continuously delivering applications, without being distracted by servers or infrastructure. Developers deploy directly from popular tools like Git, GitHub or Continuous Integration (CI) systems. The intuitive web-based Heroku Dashboard makes it easy to manage your app and gain greater visibility into performance.

## Data Services and Ecosystem

[Heroku Elements](https://www.heroku.com/elements) let developers extend their apps with Add-ons, customize their application stack with Buildpacks and jumpstart their projects with Buttons. Add-ons are 3rd party cloud services that developers can use to immediately extend their apps with a range of functionality such as data stores, logging, monitoring and more. Heroku provides three fully-managed data service Add-ons: [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres), [Heroku Redis](https://www.heroku.com/redis), and [Apache Kafka on Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/kafka).

## Heroku Operational Experience (OpEx)

The [Heroku Operational Experience](https://www.heroku.com/platform/opex) is a key component of the platform. It helps developers through troubleshooting and remediation of common issues and customizing their ops experience to quickly identify and address negative trends in their application health. Heroku provides a set of tools to alert you if something goes wrong, or to automatically scale your web dynos if the response time for web requests exceeds a threshold you specify. Application metrics, Threshold Alerting, and Autoscaling are some of the features you get access to with no extra cost.

## Security and Compliance

Developers from around the world entrust sensitive data to Heroku, and nothing is more important to us than honoring our custodial commitments to protect this data. Heroku regularly performs audits and maintains PCI, HIPAA, ISO, and SOC compliance to further strengthen our trust with customers.
