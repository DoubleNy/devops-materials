## Title: Preparation of basic teaching material on DevOps tools

It is about preparing a simple teaching practice on a DevOps tool (or more than one, if
they are related to each other) in which an interested student can learn, in the most
autonomous way possible, how to access the necessary resource or resources, and carry
out an implementation through a simple example to get started in the use of that tool or
tools. The requirements specification of the system will be carried out after selecting the
approach to be used (traditional with IEEE standards, agile, ...).
As an example of these tools: open-source technologies such as Docker, Ansible,
Jenkins, Terraform or the free tier of cloud computing services from Amazon Web
Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform; Git, GitHub, Maven, Gradle, etc. A
more complete list of candidate tools associated with DevOps can be seen at
